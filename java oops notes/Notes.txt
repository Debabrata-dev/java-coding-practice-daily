.Class
A java class is defination block which store the behaviout and propertis of an object .

.Object
An object is real world entity thst has its own meaning and states .
An object is a copy of the class which content an all the non static data member .
The non-static member are loaded to the memory when we create an object .

.Refrance Varibale-
Student obj=new Student();
(Non-           (Constructor)
premitive)
Any variable that is declare use in non-primtive data type is know as Refrance variable .
We can create a Refrance variable useing new keyword .
A Refrance variable can declare useing class name, Interfce name, Enum name .
A Refrance variable either store the address or the null vaule .

.Null
Null is keyword which meaning is nothing .
It is defult value of the java for all the Refrance variable .
When a Refrance assign a null value it is called null Refrance .
When we try to access a null Refrance it gives us a error called null Refrance error .


Deep copy-
Multiple Refrance variable of the same class with each Refrance variable assign a differnet object is know ass deep copy
If we change one Refrance variable it not affect the other Refrance variable


Shallow Copy-
Multiple Refrance variable of the same class assign a common object it is know as Shallow copy .
In case the changes made by one Refrance will affect the other Refrance variable .

MEMORY MANGEMENT
Memory Mangment in java end to end memory Mangment done by jvm at runtime .
The JVM makes of the following area classarea,heap,stack,methodarea .


classarea
All the static member are allocate to this area
All the static member are loaded by the classloader.
All static member are allocate to the memory during classloding
All the static member load to the class once.
This aree is kow ass static poll .

Heap Area-
All the non static member are allocate here .
All non static member are loading to heap area .
All the non static are allocate to the memory during object creation .
In heap area the object are not store sequencially .

Heap Area-
All the non static member are allocate here .
all the non static member are load to heap area .
All the non-static member are loaded to the heap area during object creation .
in heap area the object are not store sequencially .

Method area 
Al the memthod defination are store here .

Stack area-
All the method exeution in java done the stack area .
Stacka area fllow lifo .
ALl the variable area allocate memory to stack area .
Stack area is know as execution engine .

Stack Area
All the method execution in java are done the stack area .
This is know as Excution engine .
Stack area floow lifo .

Static Block-
Static blocks are used to initlized static data member .
Static block are directly writen the class body  useing static keyword .
In asingle static block we can initlized Multiple static datamember .
In asingle class we can declar multiplle static block .
Static block of a class are execut sequencially .


Non static
It is use to initlized non static datamember .
Non-static block are declar directly in the class body without useing static keyword .
In a single non static block we declare multiple nonstatic datamember .
In a class we can delar multiple non static datamember which is execut sequencially .
nonstatic block are execut by jvm during object creation .

Constructor 
Constructor are the special kind of datamember function that are use to intilized non static datamember during object creation .
Every class in java has a constructor is know as defult constructor .
A constructor will always same name as class name .
A constructor get execut during object creation .
In java constructor are 2 type 1-defult constructor
  2user defind constructor -1-zero argument
                            2-parametrized constructor


Zero argument constructor is create by the programmer .
In Zero arrgumment constructor we can initlized the nonstatic data inside the constructor body .
We cannot pass the arrgumment in the zero arrgumment constructor .

parametrized constructor
The parametrized constructor is created by the programmer 
In the parametrized constructor we can initlized nonstatic datamember with the help of arrgumment .

Constructor Overloading 
Constructor Overloading is the concept in which multiple constructor is create in a single class with different arrgumment
is know as constructor Overloading .
