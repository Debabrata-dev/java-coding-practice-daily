Threat:-
It is alight weight process that is application or program when it is currently under excution and consume less amount of memory .
it helps the programer to do multitasking .

it help the programer to do multitasking .
Defult Threat in java:=
when ever the java program going to excut the jvm internaly create 3 threats
1-main threats
2-garbage colllectior
3-Threat excuter .
main threat :-
It is responsible for excut the program wrriten by the programer .
garbage colllectior:-
It is responsible for clean up activity in the heap area .
Threat excuter:
It isresponsible to manages the life cycle of the threat .

garbage colllectior & Threat excuter:-
The garbage colllectior and threat excuter is know as demon threat because it low priority threat which are not 
under the programmer control .

we can create a threat in java in 2 ways 1-java Lang threat class by extending
                                         2-by imlementing 'java.lang.Runableinterface'

1st process extending:
1-First extending threat class
2-create a override run() method from thread class .
3-create an object of traget class 
4-call start() mehtod to begian thread execution .

2 By implementing java.runable runable interface
1-create a class that implementing runable interface 
2-create run() mehtod from runable interface 
3-create an object of traget class 
4-create an object of threat class by passing the interface of target class
